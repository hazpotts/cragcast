# CragCast Project Plan

## Next Actions
1. Add severe weather warnings
2. Consider ways to pull in generic crag info for the regions rather than a set list, use this to allow people to create their own custom compare page rather than a set list, use stored lat lng to get the weather, but then to get BBC or MetOffice links use the closest town with a geocode lookup, windy can use lat lng.
3. Change distance to a range not a single number
4. Check implementation
5. Add search in compare
6. Upgrade to profressional icon pack - https://www.mikeafford.com/store/weather-icons/weather-icon-set-bb-01/
7. Units manager
8. Testing
9. Add AI page with crag info
    - crag info api suggested by ai
    - MWIS
    - tell it to read UKC if possible?
    - Have it locked down to only advise on these things
    - Feed it the users prefs first
    - Plan for how to suggest crags
    - Cache initial results and rate limit
