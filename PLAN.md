# CragCast Project Plan

## Next Actions
1. Add severe weather warnings
2. Consider ways to pull in generic crag info for the regions rather than a set list, use this to allow people to create their own custom compare page rather than a set list, use stored lat lng to get the weather, but then to get BBC or MetOffice links use the closest town with a geocode lookup, windy can use lat lng. find a weather site that uses lat lng
3. Change distance to a range not a single number
4. Check implementation
5. Add search in compare
6. Upgrade to profressional icon pack - https://www.mikeafford.com/store/weather-icons/weather-icon-set-bb-01/
7. Units manager
8. Work on UX
    - Add a "compare" button to the region cards
    - Allow location without distance to use in score
    - Prompt to say what is showing when no location is set, UK Wide
    - Prompt to add location for local recommendations
    - Default to Compare?
    - Show additional cards on recommend by default?
9. Allow add to desktop
10. Testing
11. Add AI page with crag info
    - crag info api suggested by ai
    - MWIS
    - tell it to read UKC if possible?
    - Have it locked down to only advise on these things
    - Feed it the users prefs first
    - Plan for how to suggest crags
    - Cache initial results and rate limit
